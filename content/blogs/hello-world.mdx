I'm using this post to test out how things look with Markdown syntax. Over time, I'll be posting more about my pet projects, thoughts on technology, and maybe even some fun personal stories. Oh, and my cat, Luffy, is always around to offer moral support (and occasionally walk across my keyboard).

## What’s This About?

This blog will serve as a way for me to share my experiences, projects, and random thoughts with the world. For now, I’m testing the waters and making sure everything looks good. Stay tuned for more meaningful content soon..

### Headers

- Use `###` for H3 headers

### Lists

- Ordered lists with numbers

1. First item
2. Second item
